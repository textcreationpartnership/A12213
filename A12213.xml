            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, MY VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE GOOD LORD, HENRY, LORD VISCOVNT FAVLK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, LORD DEPVTIE of Ireland.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the divulging of my former Booke, (Right Honorable), there were many great and vaunting ſpeeches uttered by the pretended Catholickes, as if forthwith, or at leaſt, very ſpeedily, it ſhould have beene fully and ſufficiently anſwered. And indeede within a while after, came forth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, not to the whole Booke, but onely to a part thereof; namely, to the firſt two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contayned in the firſt part of it, made by one that calleth himſelfe <hi>Iohn at Stile:</hi> who knowing (as it ſeemeth), the weakeneſſe of his owne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
<pb facs="tcp:17943:3"/> therein promiſed, a better and further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that ſhould then ſhortly come forth to the whole Booke: which ſhould be ſo ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially done, as that it ſhould be ſuteable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the three Conditions required by me. This maner of anſwer, to the whole booke, promiſed ſo long ſince, is the thing that I have all this while expected; &amp; in expectation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I have hitherto deferred to publiſh a Reply to any other anſwere. But having now thus long expected it in vaine, &amp; not knowing when it wil appeare, or whether ever, or never: I thinke it not amiſſe, in the interim, to reply to that anſwere, which marcheth and masketh under the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Stile,</hi> as having no other, nor better, as yet, to reply unto. Where, firſt of all, it were fit to learne, what this mans right and proper name is. But becauſe hee is ſo loth to declare it, I care not much to know it; for it is not ſomuch the man, as the matter he delivereth, that I regarde. Howbeit, for his owne credite, and the credite of his cauſe, (if any credite had belonged unto it), it had beene much better for him to have put no name at all unto that his worke, then a wrong, falſe, and counterfeit name, as hee hath done. For, if in the verie firſt entrance, hee thus
<pb facs="tcp:17943:3"/> miſdemeaneth himſelfe, and feareth not to utter ſo great an untruth: What good dealing, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere truth, may we expect from him, in the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of his diſcourſe? Wherein alſo, whilſt hee ſtrived to make more haſt then good ſpeede, hee hath ſhewed himſelfe to bee, like <hi>canis feſtinans, caecos edens catulos.</hi> For, howſoever he thruſteth himſelfe forward, and will needs take upon him, to be <hi>Iohannes ad oppoſitum:</hi> yet he ſpeaketh very little, or nothing <hi>ad propoſitum.</hi> Inſomuch, that ſundry, by reaſon of the futilitie and frivolouſnes of that his anſwere, have thought it not worthy or meete to bee replied unto. Nevertheleſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all be not of that underſtanding and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to bee able to diſcerne the frivolouſnes and weakeneſſe of it: and that the pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes, doe, for their parts, ſo highly eſteeme, approve, and applaude it, (for <hi>Regnat inter caecos Luſcus</hi>): and for that I am alſo, therein, ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly touched and taxed: but chiefly and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for that Gods Religion, and his Majeſties Supremacie, (which two things ought ever to be moſt deare unto us all,) be there purpoſely and profeſſedly encountred and oppugned: I could doe no leſſe, in good dutie, and for all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but make and publiſh this my Reply unto
<pb facs="tcp:17943:4"/> it: for the further confirmation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in thoſe two maine and moſt weightie points: &amp; for the further confutation alſo, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Papiſts, &amp; making them yet more and more inexcuſable, if after ſo cleare &amp; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence of truth, (and conſequently againſt all good Conſcience,) they will ſtill bee wilfull, ſtubborne, and unreformed herein: which yet I truſt they will not be. For, they know, that <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt contra ſtimulos calcitrare:</hi>

               </hi> Doubt not, (courteous Reader), but you well remember, that, in the concluſion of my former Booke, I deſired of him that would make Anſwere thereunto, theſe three things: Firſt, that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it, not by parts or peece-meales, but wholy and intirely, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, to the end. Secondly, that he would doe it, not ſuperficially and ſophistically, but ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, ſoundly, and ſatisfactorily, if he could. Thirdly, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to doe it, as in love and Charitie, ſo alſo with an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, onely to follow Gods truth; and withall to ſet his name unto it, as I had done to that Booke of mine. But none of theſe requests hath this Anſwerer beene pleaſed to performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. For, touching the firſt: he is ſo farre from anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Booke, from the beginning of it to the end, that he hath endevoured to anſwere onely two Chapters thereof, namely the two Chapters, contayned in the firſt part of it, and no more: And whereas ſecondly I deſired, a ſound, ſufficient, and ſatisfactory Anſwere to be made; he hath anſwered even to thoſe two Chapters, (which himſelfe ſelected to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere unto,) very ſleightly, ſlenderly and ſuperficially, and in no ſorte ſubſtantially, ſoundly and ſatisfactory as ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appeare. And touching my third requeſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisteth of diverſe branches, let any man judge, that hath ſeene
<pb facs="tcp:17943:6"/> and read his Anſwere, whether it bee made, (as I deſired) in a good, loving and Charitable manner, which would best have beſeemed him: or, in a ſcoffing and deriding faſhion, in ſundrie places thereof, which doth no way become him: as alſo whether hee hath done it, with this affection, onely to follow Gods truth, or with an affection rather, to follow and advance mans errors and Constitutions, againſt a manifeſt divine truth: and laſtly, what reaſon he had, not onely, not to ſet his owne right and true name unto it, but in steede thereof, to ſet a falſe, fictitious and counterfeit name, calling himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Stile.</hi> What? Is he aſhamed of his owne right name? Or doe any uſe to get credite by putting a wrong name to their worke? But this is indeede, <hi>Dignum patella operculum:</hi> a falſe and counterfeite name, being fittest, &amp; moſt ſuteable to a falſe and counterfeite cauſe, which is the thing he maintayneth.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, as one deſirous to excuſe himſelfe herein, he ſaith, that my requiring of the Anſwerer to put his name unto the Anſwere, is in effect aſmuch, as to debarre any man from anſwering unto it: becauſe of the Statute of <hi>2. Elizabeth,</hi> which doth, (ſaith he), bind mens tongues and pennes within this Kingdome, with the corde of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> from oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Supremacie, eyther by word or writing. Whereunto I reply, that he that in anſwering is required to put his name to his anſwere, is ſo farre from being debarred from anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that cleane contrariewiſe, hee is thereby permitted to anſwere, (if hee pleaſe), ſo as he put his name thereunto. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth that Statute of <hi>2.

It is indeede, after once conviction, for the ſecond offence, a <hi>Praemunire:</hi> and for the third, High Treaſon. If then the penaltie of a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> by that Statute, be the thing he feared, you ſee there was no cauſe for him to feare it, hee being never before convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb facs="tcp:17943:6"/> or attaynted of that offence. And is it not ſtrange, that he being a Lawyer, (as he ſaith he is,) and one of thoſe, (as he likewiſe affirmeth,) that were debarred from pleading, for not taking the Oath of Supremacie, ſhould nevertheleſſe be ſo ignorant in his owne profeſsion, concerning that Statute, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though himſelfe alſo cite it,) as not to know what the penaltie is, for the firſt offence therein? May not then his owne words be here rightly returned to his owne boſome, that ſeeing, in his owne facultie he ſheweth no greater skill; Can it be imagined, that going out of his owne element, into the great Citie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, hee will doe any more, then the fiſh on the ſhoare, to gaſpe a little for ayre? But admit, that for the first offence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Statute, the penaltie had beene a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> as hee conceived: Will he therefore bee ſo faint-hearted, in that his ſuppoſed Catholicke cauſe? How doth this agree with that, which he ſaith afterward, that an Angell or a Man, is bound by the inſtinct of Nature, to love God better then themſelves? Yea, he obſerveth that in the Naturall bodie of Man, the hand will be content to looſe it ſelfe, for the preſervation of the head, and of the reſt of the members: And that in the Politicke Body of the Common-weale, any good Subject will imbrace death for the conſervation of his King, and the Common-weale: and thereupon he concludes, that ſo alſo ſhould any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian member of the Myſticall body of Chriſt, willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all diſaſters in the world, in atteſtation of his love to Chriſt, and of his willingneſſe to preſerve the honour and common good of his Church. And this motive, (ſaith he, in that his Epistle Dedicatorie,) made him, (though a Lawyer,) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe himſelfe, for the defence of the Myſticall Body of Chriſt, and to anſwere, as he hath done, in the behalfe thereof. Now then doth it become him, who ſeemeth here to be ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and couragious in his cauſe, to ſhew himſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe ſo extreamely timorous, as for feare of a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17943:7"/> not to dare to ſet his right and true name unto that his Anſwere?</p>
            <p>Yea, the premiſes being well conſidered, what reaſon hath he to taxe me, (as ſometimes he doth,) for that being a Lawyer by profeſsion, I nevertheleſſe meddle in theſe matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and concerning Religion? For, I gave before, as I thinke, a ſufficient Apologie for theſe my doings, in the Preface of my former Booke which he anſwereth not, nor is able to anſwere. And here I now may and doe further adde, that even this Man, (mine Adverſarie) hath by his owne example justified me; inaſmuch as he being likewiſe a Lawyer, (as himſelfe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth), doth nevertheleſſe, (as you ſee,) by his anſwering thoſe two Chapters in my Booke, meddle in theſe matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and concerning Religion, aſwell as I. And not onely his perſonall example, but the doctrine alſo, and reaſon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth, (namely, that every good member of the Mysticall body of Chriſt, ought to interpoſe himſelfe, for the defence of the honour of Christ, &amp; of his Church,) ſerveth very ſtrongly to juſtifie my doings herein, not only as lawfull, but as requiſite and neceſſarie, and ſuch as in dutie ought not to bee omitted. But moreover, vvhy doth he Dedicate that his Anſwere, being a worke of Divinitie, to his deareſt Countrie-men, <hi>The Lawyers of Ireland,</hi> if Lawyers had nothing to doe in theſe matters of Divinitie, or if the knowledge of things of that kind, did not belong unto them? Yea, who knoweth not, that Lawyers, and men of all profeſsions and eſtates, have ſoules to ſave; and that at the houre of their death, it is not their skill or knowledge in Law, Phyſicke, or any other their worldly callings &amp; profeſsions, (which ſerve onely but for this life,) that can doe them that good, or yeeld them that comfort touching the next world &amp; eternall happineſſe, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divinitie, and of Gods true Religion, and the care and obſervance thereof, in their life time, will be able to afford.</p>

            <p>But being debarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleading, for not taking the oath of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> he ſaith, he was deſirous to reade, what ſolide ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I had made to invest the King with the ſupremacie: &amp; finding them, (as <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> being weighed was found, in the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,) minus habens,</hi> that is, too light,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.27.</note> he ſaith he was encouraged to anſwere them. But firſt, how cometh he now to anſwere any part of my Booke, who had ſaid before in the ſame his Epiſtle Dedicatory, that he preſented it to ſome of the moſt learned of his catholicke Clergie, &amp; that none of them after a mature deliberation, held it worthy of an anſwer? what? will he thinke it worthy of an anſwere, which thoſe of the most learned of his Catholicke clergie thought it not worthy of? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if he had weighed my arguments, not with falſe Romiſh weights, but with true &amp; divine weights, that is, in ſuch a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as God weighed <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> he would have found them weighty enough, though <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was found light. Thirdly, little reaſon hath he to call &amp; account thoſe arguments light, ſomewhereof be ſuch, as he dares not touch nor medle with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but doth, as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> uſe to do, who, what they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reade, they skippe over: So, what he can no way anſwere, he pretermitteth: &amp; thoſe which he dare be bold to touch, doe nevertheleſſe ſhew themſelves to be of that weight and strength, as that he is not able to ſtirre, or move them, much leſſe to remove them, or to lift them up from that ground, whereon they reſt. Himſelfe doth what he can, to anſwere them; yet diſtrusting his ovvne Anſwere, as <hi>minus habens,</hi> (to uſe his owne wordes againſt him,) that is, as being too light, weake, and inſufficient, hee promiſeth a more ſatisfying Anſwere that ſhould afterward come forth from thoſe that have more Lavv and Divinitie, then eyther he, or I. Yea, he ſaith againe, That my Booke ſhall be ſhortly anſwered, in my owne straine of Divinitie, with the three conditions required by me.

I graunt that my profeſsion and place, would have allowed me, to have written of points of Law, and concerning Civill Iuſtice, and externall Peace: But I have rendered the reaſon in the Epiſtle Dedicatorie of my former Booke, why I medled not with thoſe things, Namely, becauſe the pretended Catholickes of this Kingdome, in thoſe points, ſhewed no refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarineſſe or oppoſition, but good conformitie and obedience: And, that, their defect was onely in the two other points, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Concerning the Kings <hi>Supremacie,</hi> and the <hi>Religion:</hi> whereof therefore, there then was, &amp; ſtill is, greateſt neede, and moſt urgent occaſion to treate. Wherefore, hee that in ſuch a Caſe, would rather have had a Compendium of the Law, then theſe two most neceſſarie, and most important matters to bee
<pb facs="tcp:17943:8"/> dealt in for the generall good of the kingdome, ſeemeth in my understanding, to have made a great <hi>diſpendium</hi> of his wit and judgement.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe hee proceedeth, and ſaith, that becauſe hee cannot commaund the Preſſe, he will imploy his endevours, to anſwere, in a Manuſcript, my first Booke; (he meaneth the firſt part of my Booke, contayning thoſe two Chapters aforeſaid:) But what neceſsitie was there for him thus to publiſh his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in a Manuſcript, which he might have put in Print, if he had ſo pleaſed? For, although he could not commaund the Proteſtants Preſſe (neyther was it fit, he ſhould), yet the Preſſe, which ſome ſay, the Papists have of their owne, within this kingdome, he might have eyther commaunded or intreated: or if they have no Preſſe within this kingdome, he might have ſent or carried his Anſwere unto <hi>Doway,</hi> or to <hi>Rhemes,</hi> or to ſome other place beyond the Seas, where it might have beene printed, if they had held it worthy the Printing. Seeing then that hee might have printed it; Why did he rather chooſe to divulge it in a Manuſcript? Did he thinke, that by that courſe uſed, he might the more freely ſpeake and write what he listed, and that no man would anſwere or reply unto it, though he be never ſo much touched in it, or be the cauſe, therein handled, of never ſo great importance? But what reaſon is there for any man, to clayme, expect, or to be allowed ſuch a priviledge? Yea, inaſmuch as mens hearts may be poyſoned, and ſeduced, aſwell by Manuſcripts, and written Bookes and Pamphlets, as by thoſe that be Printed, eſpecially after they be once ſcattered and diſperſed abroad, (as this his Anſwere is), into diverſe mens hands, and are withall ſuppoſed by the pretended Catholickes, (for whoſe ſake all that labour is beſtowed), to contayne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth: I ſee not but I may bee as bold to reply to his Manuſcript, in Print, (the cauſe alſo ſo requiring), as he made bold to anſwere a part of my Printed Booke, in a Manuſcript.

As for that godly, learned, Reverend, and worthy Biſhoppe of <hi>Meath,</hi> whom my Adverſary mentioneth in his Epiſtle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie: I ſhall neede to ſay nothing of him, becauſe himſelfe will ever be beſt able to ſpeake for himſelfe, whenſoever anie ſhall ſhew themſelves in oppoſition againſt him.</p>
            <p>But to proceede with mine Adverſary, if he be, (as he ſaith he is) debarred from pleading for not taking the Oath of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie;</hi> Whom can he blame therein, but himſelfe, for his ſo unjuſt refuſing to take ſo just an Oath? Againſt which throughout all his anſwere, himſelfe neyther ſheweth, nor is able to ſhew any good exception: which, no doubt, hee would there have ſhewed, where the <hi>Supremacie</hi> was purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, if he had beene able to have ſhewed it. But to make him yet the more in excuſable, (if he will ſtill be obſtinate, which I would have, neyther him, nor any others to be), I have here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at large declared, the right of the Kings Supremacie, over all manner of Perſons, and in all kindes of cauſes, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> aſwell as <hi>Civill,</hi> for his, &amp; all other mens moſt ample and moſt full ſatisfaction in that point. And yet my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie ſaith, That he will Arme himſelfe with little Divinitie, and leſſe Philoſophie, to enter the liſts againſt mee: which
<pb facs="tcp:17943:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> though it be ſpoken, (after the Papisticall manner), proudly, ſcornefully, and like another <hi>Goliah;</hi> yet therein hee ſpeaketh truer then he was aware of. For not to ſpeake of his Philoſophy, (which he ſheweth indeede to be verie little), this my Reply to his Anſwere, will diſcover him to be as very a Punie in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, (as touching any good skill, or found judgement, in it), as he is in Law. In ſomuch that upon reading of this Booke, his anſwere will appeare to be as good as no Anſwere, yea that it had beene better for his cauſe, if hee had beene ſilent, and ſpoken nothing in it: Such is the advantage that truth ever getteth againſt falſhood, when falſhood dare be ſo bold, to ſtand in oppoſition againſt it. As for the multitude of his idle words, his many needeleſſe Sillogiſmes, his extravagant ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and impertinent diſcourſes, I paſſe them over, for the moſt part, not vouchſafing an Anſwere to them: they being inſerted, but to fill up paper, to miſpend time, and vainely to delight and pleaſe himſelfe, and his followers. But where he hath alledged any thing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ſecond Poſition he buſieth himſelfe in, is that the Regall Power or authoritie, is ſubordinate to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall or Spirituall. It is true, that Kings &amp; Princes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Regall power, be ſubordinate and ſubject to God, and his authoritie. But what of this? Indeede, if Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters ſpake to Kings and Princes, in their owne names, and by their owne authoritie, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their owne will and pleaſure, there might be ſome reaſon in that which he would conclude: but ſeeing they are to ſpeake unto them, not their owne will, but the will and word of the Almightie, and in his Name, and as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17943:12"/> Miniſters, Meſſengers, and ſervants unto him, no ſuch conſequent can be inferred.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor</hi> 5 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 1.2.</note> For if a King ſend an Eſquier, or any other inferior ſervant of his, on a meſſage, to a Duke, Earle, or other Noble-man of the Realme: This ſervant ſpeaking in the King his Maſters name, and delivering his meſſage, is therein to be obeyed: Will any thereupon conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> That Eſquier or ſervant, is greater, or ſuperior, as in reſpect of himſelfe, or of his owne perſon, then eyther the Duke or the Earle, or the Noble-man? No man, I thinke, will be ſo abſurd. And yet my Adverſarie goeth on, and amplifieth the Sacerdotall, and ſpirituall power, ſaying: That how much the Soule in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection exceedes the Bodie: The eternall bliſſe, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicitie: The Divine Lawes, the humane lawes: By ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much doth the Spirituall authoritie exceede the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. But all this while, he ſhould remember and obſerve, wherein, and in what reſpects, it is, that this excellencie of the one, above the other, doth conſiſt. For as it is true, that in reſpect of converting ſoules, and fitting them for Gods kingdome, by preaching of Gods Word, Adminiſtring of the Sacraments, and exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; the Spirituall function, and authoritie is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, before the Regall or temporall: So no leſſe true is it, that in reſpect of the temporall Power of the Sword, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally to command, compell, and to puniſh offendors, in cauſes both Eccleſiaſticall, and Civill, the Regall &amp; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, Office, and Authoritie, is to be preferred before the Epiſcopall, or Sacerdotall. When therefore he ſuppoſeth, that the King or Prince, in reſpect of the Prieſt, is but as the bodie is, in reſpect of the Soule; and that hee hath no more power and authoritie, over Prieſts and Biſhoppes, then the bodie hath over the Soule: How doth he prove this fond conceite? For it is not the credite or teſtimonie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17943:12"/> of his S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> (as he calleth him,) who lived more then 1200. yeares after CHSIST, and was overwhelmed with the corruption of his time, and wedded to the Sea of Rome, that can bee any ſufficient proofe of that idle fantazie: Yea, it is apparant that to ſome purpoſes, the Regall Power, &amp; Office, hath in it, the nature, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the ſoule, aſwell as the Sacerdotall, or Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall hath, to ſome other purpoſes.

For, (by ſuch a reaſon), you may aſwell conclude againſt the one, as againſt the other.

Wherefore this was not a matter of modeſty, or courteſie in the Pope,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17943:20"/> (as <hi>Gratian</hi> moſt ungratiouſly would perſwade,) but a matter of bounden duetie,<note place="margin">Ibidem. Cap. Petrus.</note> and without all diſſembling, and ſeriouſly meant and intended by him, in ſuch manner and ſort, as he by thoſe his words plainely declareth. And conſequently you now perceive verie fully, (I hope,) that for the ſpace of eight hundred yeares and more after CHRIST, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſubject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and that the Chriſtian Emperors alſo had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in matters Eccleſiaſticall, aſwell as Civill, within their Empyres.</p>
               <p>But here now doe ſome Papiſts take exception and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, as touching <hi>Salomon,</hi> his diſplacing of <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Prieſt, and putting <hi>Sadoc</hi> in his place: that <hi>Salomon</hi> did this, as he was a Prophet, not as hee was a King. But, firſt this is but a meere ſuppoſition and conceit, not found warranted in the Text. Yea, the untruth of it may appeare if you pleaſe but to reade the Chapter: For the offence which <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 2.22.23.24 25.26.27.28 29 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> the high Prieſt, had committed, was High Treaſon, in joyning with <hi>Adoniah,</hi> againſt King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> for the kingdome: <hi>Ioah</hi> alſo was in the ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſpiracie. The King therefore cauſed <hi>Adoniah</hi> to be put to death: he cauſed alſo <hi>Ioab</hi> to be put to death: &amp; touching <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Prieſt, hee was alſo as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death as the reſt, although for ſome cauſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, he was ſpared for that time. <hi>Thou art worthie of death,</hi>

                  <hi>in the roome of Abiathar.</hi> In which words you ſee, that <hi>Salomon</hi> doing theſe things, is not ſtyled or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17943:20"/> called by the name of a Prophet, but expreſſely, by the name of a King: thereby ſignifying and declaring, that what <hi>Salomon</hi> did touching the removing of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and putting <hi>Sadoc</hi> in his place, he did it as a King, aſwell as when he put <hi>Benaiah,</hi> in the place of <hi>Ioab.</hi> Secondly, you ſee, that the offence which <hi>Abiathar</hi> had committed, was treaſon, and that therefore he deſerved to die, aſwell as <hi>Adoniah,</hi> or <hi>Ioab,</hi> or any other of the conſpirators: But yet for the reaſons and reſpects before mentioned, hee would not, then, put him to death, though he had deſerved it, but was content, in lieu thereof, for that time, to inflict this puniſhment upon him, to have him removed from his Prieſt-hood. Now to deale in caſes of Treaſon, and to be a Iudge of matters concerning life and death, and to award execution of death, or in mercie to mitigate, and alter the ſeveritie of that puniſhment, and in lieu thereof, to have a milder, or not ſo ſevere a puniſhment as death, to be inflicted, be things, not properly belonging to the office of a Prophet, but to the office of a King, they doe rightly and properly enough belong. And therefore what <hi>Salomon</hi> did herein, it is evident that he did it as a King, &amp; not as a Prophet. And conſequently it ſtill remayneth firme and ſure, even by this example of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> as alſo by other examples mentioned in my former Booke, (whereto my adverſarie is ſtill pleaſed to anſwere nothing), that Kings, as Kings, have power to place Biſhops, and againe to diſplace them, when there is cauſe, and to put others in their roome.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17943:33"/> and expreſſely diſtinguiſhed. For, firſt, my purpoſe was to prove his Majeſties SUPREMACIE, over all perſons, within his owne Dominions: and then afterward in the ſecond place, to ſhew his Authoritie in reſpect of <hi>Cauſes Eccleſiasticall,</hi> aſwell as <hi>Civill.</hi> In the firſt Section of that Chapter, <hi>pag.</hi> 1.2.3.4. I handle the firſt point, concerning his Supremacie, in reſpect of perſons: and in the ſecond ſection <hi>pag. 5.</hi> and not before, it is, that I begin to handle his Authoritie in reſpect of cauſes. This Text then of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> being alledged, (as it is), in the firſt ſection, and <hi>pag. 1.</hi> was by me produced, to prove onely his Majeſties Supremacie over all perſons, aſwell Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as Civill, within his owne Dominions, and not for any ſuch end, or purpoſe, as thereby to prove his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Authoritie in cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> aſwell as <hi>Civill,</hi> as he miſconceaveth. But ſith he will needes have it ſo uſed, I am well content with it: becauſe that Text, doth indeede ſerve verie ſufficiently, to prove both thoſe purpoſes. For the firſt, the argument is verie apparant, and may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus. If all perſons aſwell Eccleſiaſticall, as Civill, are to be ſubject to their King, as to the Chiefe or Supreme within his owne Dominions, then hath their King a cleare Supremacie over them all: But all perſons aſwell Eccleſiaſticall, as Civill, are to be ſubject to their King, as to the Chiefe or Supreme, within his owne Dominions, (for ſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> directly teacheth:) <hi>Ergo</hi> their King hath a cleare Supremacie over them all. And for the ſecond point, the argument is alſo very open, and evident: For the King is not called the Chiefe, or Supreme, in reſpect onely of the excellencie of his perſon above all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but in reſpect alſo of his Authoritie, Rule, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, he hath over them: yea in this reſpect ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is ſo called, as appeareth by this, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that here we finde, the Kings Title of Supreme Governor, very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proved, and directly ratified, and confirmed.

                  </note> (as the ſame S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> againe ſaith,) <hi>a King ſerveth God one way, as he is a man: and another way, as he is a King: As a Man he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God by living well and faithfully: But as he is a King, he ſerveth God by ſetting forth Lawes, to command that which is good, and to remove the contrarie. So that Kings, as Kings, ſerve God, in doing that for his ſervice, which none but Kings can doe.</hi> Wherefore my Argument to prove the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Emperors, Kings, and Princes, in both thoſe points together, out of this Text of <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> is this: whoſoever hath Authoritie to puniſh evill-doers, without exception of any perſon, and without exception of any cauſe, hath Authoritie over all perſons, and in all cauſes aſwell Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall as Civill: But the Emperor within his Empyre, and the King within his Kingdomes, hath Authoritie to puniſh evill-doers without exception of any perſon, and without exception of any cauſe, (as is apparant by the Text it ſelfe, wherein no exception is to be found.) <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Emperor within his Empyre, and the King within his kingdomes, hath authoritie over all perſons, and in all cauſes, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Civill.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But now from this Text of <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> alledged in the <hi>5. pag.</hi> of that firſt Chapter in my Booke, concerning the SUPREMACIE: My Adverſarie commeth next to the point of <hi>Appeales,</hi> mentioned in the ſame firſt Chapter, <hi>pag. 24.</hi> So, that he here skippeth over 9. whole leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one leape: and I muſt follow him in his courſe.

Where, beſide that you ſee, that this Chriſtian Emperor made Commiſsioners in this Epiſcopall and Eccleſiaſtical cauſe, obſerve withall, that <hi>Miltiades</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was one of thoſe Commiſsoners, and there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all you may alſo note, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> were then verie clearely ſubject and not ſuperior to the Emperor. So that a Chriſtian King, or Prince, not onely may make Commiſsioners in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, but may alſo have <hi>Appeales</hi> made unto him, as is here apparant. To this my Adverſarie maketh divers anſwers. <hi>First,</hi> (he ſaith,) <hi>that this inſtance concerning Appeales, maketh more againſt me, then for me, becauſe it was an Appeale made by Hereticks,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Donatiſts, unto the Emperor.</hi> But this reaſon of his, maketh more againſt him, then ſet him. For if it were lawfull for Heretickes, who thought themſelves wronged by the inferior Iudges, to appeale to the Emperor: no leſſe (if not much more lawfull was it) for the Orthodoxe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops if they were wronged, to appeale to him. And if <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> that Orthodoxe, godly and Chriſtian Emperor, thought it lawfull for him, (as hee did, for otherwiſe hee would never have meddled with it,) to entertaine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave an appeale made to him from Heretickes: much more would hee have thought it lawfull and meete to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave <hi>Appeales</hi> from ſuch as were Orthodoxe, right &amp; true Chriſtians, and men, for Faith &amp; Religion, like himſelfe. But that he may know, that not onely heretickes, but <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe</hi> Biſhops alſo,<note place="margin">Athan. Apolog. <hi>2</hi> cap. Quum multas.</note> did appeale to the Emperor: Let him take for an evident proofe of it, the example of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:17943:40"/> and of the other Biſhops joyned with him, who, (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed,) appealed from the Councell of <hi>Tyrus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Socrat lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>33.</hi> &amp; <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> unto the ſame godly Emperor <hi>Constantine:</hi> which appeale the ſame Emperor likewiſe receaved. Neyther would <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> nor any other good and godly Biſhops have appealed unto him, if they had not thought it lawful, both for them ſo to doe, and for the Emperor alſo to receive ſuch appeales. Neyther did the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> appeale onely from <hi>Miltiades</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe that were joyned with him by Commiſsion from the Emperor: But, they appealed alſo from thoſe other Biſhops, that were afterward aſſembled at <hi>Arle</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ending of the ſame cauſe. And both theſe <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales</hi> did the Emperor receive, and upon the laſt appeale, he ſate himſelfe in perſon, and gave Iudgement for <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatists:</hi> whoſe proceedings and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon thoſe appeales, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſliked not, but well liked and allowed: alledging them, as being ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proofes for the Catholickes, and lawfull, good, and effectuall judgements againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> I grant that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was loth at the firſt, to be Iudge in this Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall cauſe, in his owne perſon,<note place="margin">Aug Epist. <hi>166</hi>

                  </note> to be malicious wranglers. Againe, the ſame S. <hi>Angustine</hi> ſaith: that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> appealed from <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> judgement, to the end that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> might heare the cauſe: Whither, when they came, both parties ſtanding before him, <hi>Caecilianus</hi> was adjudged to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> overthrowne. To prove this I will further bring you, (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>), the very wordes of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> where he witneſseth, <hi>That upon judiciall hearing of both ſides, he found Caecilianus to be cleare.</hi> Yea, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth further, what followed upon this judgement;<note place="margin">Aug.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Then did Conſtantine,</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>make a ſharpe law, to puniſh the Donatists: his ſonnes continued the ſame. Reade, vvhat Valentinian, reade when you vvill, vvhat Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and Theodoſius, Decreed, againſt you. Why vvonder you then, at the Children of Theodoſius, as if they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved any other preſident in this cauſe, then the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſtantine, vvhich ſo many Chriſtian Emperors have kept inviolate? Though Constantine bee dead, yet the judgement of Constantine, given againſt you, liveth. For, vvhen Emperors command that vvhich is good, it is Christ and no man elſe, that commandeth by them.</hi> Thus you ſee how much this judgement of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,</hi> made to him, (though by <hi>Donatists</hi>), was not onely juſtified and approved by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but embraced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by other Chriſtian Emperors, as <hi>Vertuous,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as <hi>Religious,</hi> and honoured of the whole Orthodoxe Church, in that time. So little cauſe hath mine Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or any other Papiſts, to miſlike of <hi>Constantine</hi> his

For elſe may you ſay, that thoſe Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Arle,</hi> (whom S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſely calleth <hi>Iudices, Iudges</hi>), were alſo no Iudges, becauſe they likewiſe, aſwell as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> acquited <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and condemned the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and ſo approved the ſentence of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and his Colleagues declaring it to be juſt.

So up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Appeale</hi> made to the Emperor, when he in his own perſon, ſate, as Iudge therein, having power in himſelfe,

Yea it doth rather verie ſtrongly, and moſt ſtrongly prove the Emperor to bee a Iudge, and the Chiefeſt and higheſt Iudge under God, and to have the Supremacie over the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſwell, as over other Biſhops within the precincts of the Empyre.

For <hi>Donatus</hi> and his partakers objected, that <hi>Cacilianus</hi> could not be Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for many crimes ſurmiſed againſt him, and eſpecially, for that <hi>Felix</hi> which impoſed hands on him, had, (as they ſaid), be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed or burnt the Scriptures.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17943:44"/> there was alſo in thoſe times of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> no appeale to be made but to God onely.</p>
               <p>But here now my Adverſarie goeth about by alledging <hi>Appeales</hi> to have beene made to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a ſupremacie to belong unto him: and for proofe thereof, he citeth ſome examples, as namely: Firſt, that of <hi>Marcion,</hi> who being excommunicate,<note place="margin">Epiph. haeroſ. <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to be abſolved by the Biſhop there, (as he alledgeth out of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius.</hi>): Howbeit, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth not ſay, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired this abſolution of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of diverſe plurally, namely, a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>That they that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by one Biſhop, ſhould not be abſolved of another.</hi> Wherefore all this maketh much againſt the ſupremacie of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but nothing for him.

                  </note> but cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewiſe he utterly miſliketh, and condemneth it. For, writing to the ſame <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons condemned in Africke by the Biſhops there, Romam cum mendacioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> merce navigaverunt, Sayled to Rome with their fraite of lyes:</hi> And againſt this hee addeth further, <hi>That it is a thing equall and right, that everie mans cauſe ſhould be there heard, where the crime was committed.</hi> Againe he ſaith, <hi>That every Paſtor, hath a portion of the Lords flock
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17943:45"/> aſsigned unto him, vvhich he muſt governe and rule, as hee that must give an account of his doings unto God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludeth, that <hi>Oportet eos quibus praeſumus, non cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcurſare, &amp;c. Thoſe that be under our rule and governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought not to runne thus about (to Rome) but ought there to plead their cauſe, where they may finde both accuſers and witneſſes: unleſſe perhaps,</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>a few deſperate and looſe Companions, ſuppoſe the authoritie of a Biſhop of Africke, to be leſſe then the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome:</hi> which hee ſpeakes as accounting it abſurd, for any man to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Authoritie of the one, to be greater then the Authoritie of the other.</p>
               <p>His third example is of <hi>Athanaſius, who being depoſed from his Biſhopricke, made his appeale,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to Pope Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, and was by him restored.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being oppreſſed, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thruſt from his Biſhopricke, (as diverſe other Biſhops likewiſe were in thoſe dayes) fled to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to acknowledge any ſupremacie in him over all other Biſhops, as now he claymeth but as to a friend, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, at whoſe hands he expected and hoped, to finde ſome helpe and defence in that his diſtreſſe.<note place="margin">Sozomen. libr. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi> lat.</note>

Now, if <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had had the power and authoritie in thoſe times to call generall Councells, Why did hee not call them? Yea, why did he, by his Legats intreate and beſeech the Emperors to doe it, if it were a right belonging to himſelfe, or if it were not a right belonging to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in thoſe dayes? Or, if he were then the ſupreme commander of all the Chriſtian world (as the Popes now clayme to be) how commeth it to paſſe, that he was ſuch an humble ſuter to the Emperors for a Councell, and yet could not obtaine it? Doe not all theſe things, ſtrongly and invincibly declare, that in thoſe times, not the Popes, but the Emperors, had clearely the ſupremacie?</p>

But, as it ſeemeth, he is an hard man, that neyther out of his owne courteſie, nor yet upon the intreatie of others, will be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſhew ſo ſmall a kindeneſſe. What? Is it, becauſe better matter fayled him, that he tooke this ſilly exception and ſtandeth ſo much upon it?

In ſomuch, that Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus</hi> himſelfe ingenuouſly confeſſeth and affirmeth, that, <hi>The firſt eight generall Councells were called by the Emperors.</hi> Is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17943:53"/> there then any credite at all to be given to thoſe Papiſts in theſe dayes, who doe and dare denie this ſo cleare, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and evident a truth? Wherefore it being a thing moſt apparant, that in ancient times the Emperors by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and commandement, called the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: it followeth neceſſarily thereupon, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors thereby commanded aſwell the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the other Biſhops, and conſequently had the Supremacie, aſwell over the one, as over the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But yet further to prove the Supremacie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, I alledged, that the Emperors in ancient time, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, impriſoned, and otherwiſe alſo puniſhed, by their Authoritie, even ſome of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves, aſwell as other Biſhops. Whereunto mine Adverſarie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that, <hi>Theſe things they did, de facto, but not warrantable de jure.</hi> But why were they not warrantable <hi>de jure?</hi> I grant, that a baniſhment or impriſonment may poſſibly be ſometimes wrongfull and unjuſt, in reſpect of the man, and the matter, that deſerveth it not: but this is no impeachment or argument therefore againſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the authoritie. As if an Emperor, or King doe baniſh, or committe a man to priſon, for profeſſing any point of true Religion, this baniſhment and impriſonment is wrongfull and unjuſt, in reſpect of the cauſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth no puniſhment at all. Yet it cannot be denied, but he hath power &amp; Authoritie good and lawfull enough, both to baniſh, and to committe to priſon notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when there is a juſt cauſe: For that which is but an abuſe of Authoritie, doth not take away the lawfull uſe of it. So that if any Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any Biſhop who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever within the Dominions of the Empyre, did offend ſo farre, as to deſerve baniſhment, impriſonment, or other Temporall and Civill puniſhment, it was a thing lawfull
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17943:53"/> and juſt for the Emperor, to inflict thoſe puniſhments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, aſwell as upon any other. For it is, indeede, to theſe <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> namely, to Emperors,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.2.3.4</note> Kings and Princes, that God hath committed the Civill and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſword, for the encouragement and prayſe of them that doe well, &amp; for the diſcouragement, terror, &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that doe evill: And theſe be <hi>Ministri Dei, The Ministers of God,</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſheweth,) <hi>inſtituted for that verie end and purpoſe.</hi> Now none will denie, but baniſhment, and impriſonment, be puniſhments Civill and Temporall, and not <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and doe rightly and properly belong to the Authority of Emperors, Kings and Princes, and not to the function and office of Biſhops, and Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters. And therefore the baniſhment, and impriſonment, that any Emperors or Kings, uſed againſt any Biſhops, or others upon juſt cauſe, and when they deſerved it, muſt needes be granted to be things done by them, (both in reſpect of the authoritie, and in reſpect of the cauſe alſo,) aſwell <hi>de jure,</hi> as <hi>de facto,</hi> that is, to be things lawfull, warrantable, and juſtifieable, in all reſpects. For, as for thoſe diſtinctions, that Emperors and Kings have Authoritie, over perſons <hi>Temporall,</hi> but not <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall:</hi> and a <hi>Power directive,</hi> but not <hi>Coactive,</hi> and in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Temporall,</hi> but <hi>not in Eccleſiaſticall:</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, abſurditie, folly, &amp; impietie of all theſe diſtinctions, hath beene before ſo ſufficiently diſcovered, that I ſhall not neede to ſpeake any more of them: And by this time, I hope, that even the Papiſts themſelves bee aſhamed of them: Sure I am, they have good cauſe ſo to be, if they did duely ponder, and conſider them.</p>
               <p>Seeing then it is confeſſed, that the Emperors did in ancient time by their Authoritie, baniſh, impriſon, and otherwiſe puniſh even Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſwell as other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17943:54"/> Biſhops, &amp; that no reaſon can be ſhewed againſt the doing hereof, when they be ſuch offenders, as that they juſtly deſerve ſuch puniſhment, it is thereby undeniably appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe dayes had not the ſupremacie over the Emperors, but that cleane contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Emperors had the Supremacie over him, aſwell, as over any others within their Empy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another Argument which I uſe, conſiſteth in this, that I ſay, even Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> did alſo ſometimes ſend the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Embaſſadors. By this argument my Adverſarie ſaith, <hi>That he ſuppoſeth, that I meant, but to make men merry.</hi> Why? In ſerious matters, I love not to be (as he is many times,) ridiculous, but to be ſerious, and to deale ſeriouſly. Firſt therefore, hereby I prove that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not in thoſe dayes, ſuperior or greater then the King, that ſent him: For thoſe wordes of Chriſt muſt ever be true, where he ſaith: <hi>The Servant is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his Master,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, I ſay further, that this is a verie good and ſtrong argument, to prove the Supremacie to be, in thoſe dayes, in the Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not in the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, the King that ſendeth any, as his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, is in all common underſtanding, ſuppoſed, and to be ſuppoſed, ſuperior unto him that is his Embaſſador.

For amongſt men, the Maſter is wont to ſend the Servant, and the King his Subject, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior his inferior. But where did you ever reade, heare, or know, the Servant to ſend his Maſter, or the Subject to ſend his King and Soveraigne, or the inferior to ſend his Superior on a meſſage? I grant that an inferior, or equall may intreate a Superior to doe a buſineſſe for him, and that a King, a Maſter, or Superior, may goe by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or of his owne accord, ſomewhither, to doe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Servant, or inferior, a good turne.

For the queſtion was onely concerning them, whether of them had the Superioritie, or Supremacie, over the other, in that time, namely, whether the Kings that then raigned over <hi>Rome,</hi> or, thoſe that were the Biſhops thereof. I to prove the Superioritie or Supremacie, to be in the Kings, and not in the Biſhops, alledged this for my reaſon, that the Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſometimes ſend the Biſhops of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17943:55"/> 
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Embaſſadors, to other Princes: So that my Argument upon the whole matter, appeareth to be this. What Kings ſoever, (I ſpeake of earthly Kings,) ſent any at any time, as their Embaſſadors, to other Princes, thoſe Kings were Superior and greater, then thoſe Embaſſadors whom they ſent: But the Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſend the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Embaſſadors, to other Princes: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> the Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> were Superior, and greater then the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> is apparant by induction of particulars, &amp; by ordinarie &amp; common experience in the world. The <hi>Minor</hi> is manifeſt by Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, which teſtifieth, <hi>That King Theodoricke, ſent Iohn Biſhop of Rome,</hi>

By this time then, mine Adverſarie ſeeth, (I hope,) that ſuch is the evident ſtrength of this Argument, as that he with all his wit and learning, will never bee able to make any good anſwere thereunto.</p>
               <p n="10">10 In my former Booke, <hi>Cap. 1. pag. 13. 14. 15.</hi> I alſo ſhewed, that againſt the title and appellation of <hi>Vniverſall Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>head</hi> of the univerſall Church, did two Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſe themſelves, namely, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>great,</hi> when it was firſt affected by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch, and Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> And that nevertheleſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> namely, <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> got, &amp; obtayned it of <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Emperor.

As alſo I truſt you now ſufficiently great, how fond and falſe an evaſion, that is, which my Adverſarie, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo uſeth. For, if this granting of the title of the univerſall Biſhop to <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> had beene, (as they ſay,) nothing elſe, but a declaration of the thing, ever before acknowledged to belong to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> What cauſe, or neede was there, for <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have beene ſuch an earneſt, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſurer for the obtayning of it, at this time? Or, why did thoſe two Patriarches, the one of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the other of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtrive and contend, at this time, ſo much for it? Or why was <hi>Phocas</hi> himſelfe ſo hardly, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much a doe, induced to yeeld it to <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was then the ſeate of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Or if it were a thing ever before acknowledged, to be due, to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> why did thoſe two Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo hotely and eagerly oppoſe themſelves, againſt it, utterly deteſting and condemning it, not onely in <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but generally in all Biſhops who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? as their ſpeeches, arguments, and reaſons doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Yea, how can it be true, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had evermore this title, when <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>great,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> himſelfe teſtifieth the cleane contrarie: ſaying, (as you heard before), that none of his predeceſſors, Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> did at any time conſent to uſe ſo ungodly a name:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17943:57"/> and that no Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> at any time, tooke upon him, this name of ſingularitie: and, that they the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> could not take it, though it were offered to them. Is it not then a point of groſſe impudencie in Papiſts ſtill to denie ſuch apparant and manifeſt truths?</p>
               <p>But afterward againe in a ſcoffing manner, hee ſaith, that I give notice that I am a <hi>Logician,</hi> by affirming in the <hi>11. pag.</hi> of the firſt part of my Booke, that the effect of the negative clauſe in the Oath of Supremacie, is included in the former affirmative clauſe of the ſame Oath. The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative clauſe, (ſaith he,) of the Oath, is that the King is the Supreme Governor in his owne Dominions: The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative clauſe is, that no forraine Prince, Perſon, Prelate, &amp;c. And ſo he goeth on, miſpending his time, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the imagination and deviſe of his owne braine. For, the affirmative clauſe in the Oath, is not, as he imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lamely relateth it, but it is this: That the King, is the onely Supreme Governor of this Realme, and of all other his Highneſſe Dominions and Countries, aſwell in all Spirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall things or cauſes, as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. The negative clauſe followeth, and is this; That no forraine Prince, Perſon, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have, any juriſdiction, power, ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, preheminence, or authoritie Eccleſiaſticall, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, within this Realme. This word, <hi>(Onely,)</hi> in the affirmative clauſe, hath he left out: which if he had added together with all the reſt of the wordes, that follow in that affirmative clauſe: he would very eaſily have found that to be true, which I wrote, namely, that the effect of the negative clauſe, is included in the former affirmative. For, he that affirmeth the King, to be the onely Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor within his owne Dominions, &amp; that in all things, or cauſes Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall, aſwell as temporall:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17943:57"/> doth, in that ſpeech, exclude every forraine Prince, perſon, Prelate, State, or Potentate, from having any ſupreme governement, or any government at all, without his leave and licence, within his Dominions. Yea, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the former affirmative clauſe includeth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative clauſe, and more. For the negative clauſe excludeth forrain Princes, perſons, Prelates, States &amp; Pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tates, only from Eccleſiaſticall, or Spirituall Authoritie: but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affirmative excludeth them from authoritie in all things or cauſes both temporall &amp; ſpirituall. Againe, you ſee that the negative clauſe extendeth onely to forraine perſons: but the affirmative clauſe extendeth to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſoever, whether forraine, or domeſticall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the negative clauſe excludeth forraine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from having any juriſdiction, power, ſuperioritie, preheminence, or Authoritie Eccleſiaſticall, or ſpirituall, within this Realme. But, the former affirmative clauſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not only to this Realme, or that Realme, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but generally to all his Majeſties Realms, Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; Countries. So that the former affirmative clauſe, in the Oath, appeareth to be much more generall, and of a farre larger extent, then the negative is. And therefore, I hope, I ſpake truely, and within compaſſe, when I ſaid, (though in a <hi>parentheſis</hi>), that the effect of the negative clauſe, was included in the former affirmative. I did not ſay, (as mine Adverſarie ſuppoſeth me to hold;) that the Regall power includeth the Sacerdotall, or Epiſcopall. This is but his owne dreame &amp; imagination: in the confutation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he laboureth in vaine. For, neyther I, nor any of the Proteſtants, doe hold that opinion, but contrariewiſe doe hold them to be things diſtinct, as is before declared. But becauſe he will needes carpe at my Logicke, when he hath no cauſe: let other men judge, what a great <hi>Logician</hi> he is,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17943:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> whilſt he argueth thus. The Regall power includeth not the Sacerdotall: <hi>Ergo</hi> the affirmative clauſe in the Oath of SUPREMACIE, includeth not the negative clauſe in the ſame Oath.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, then you ſee, that my Adverſarie, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his ſtoriſhes, braggs, and bravadoes), hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himſelfe to be, not onely a punie Lawyer, (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to be,) but a punie Logician alſo, &amp; moſt of all, a punie Divine: and that he hath not beene able, to make any good Anſwere, or to refell and confute any one Argument contayned in this firſt Chapter of my former Booke, concerning the Supremacie: and yet hath he alſo left a great part of that Chapter unanſwered. Neyther hath he made throughout his whole diſcourſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo much as one good argument, to prove his Clients cauſe, that is, the Popes ſupremacie: though he purpoſed, and laboured to doe it. Where, is it not a mervaile; that he being a Lawyer, and a Subject to our Soveraigne Lord, the KING, will date nevertheleſſe admitte of ſuch a Client, as the Pope is, and of his cauſe, which he knoweth before hand, to be condemned, by the Lawes, and Statutes of the Realme, and which he now may ſee, (if hee ſaw it not before,) to be alſo condemned by the Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of God himſelfe, and by all the moſt ancient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Records. But, if hee be not aſhamed of ſuch a Client and his cauſe: his Client, (I ſuppoſe,) will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him, and entertaine him no longer, to pleade for him, unleſſe he could doe it better. And yet indeede, when his Clients cauſe, is foule, &amp; naught, (as here it appeareth to be,) what Lawyer, be he never ſo learned, or what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, be hee never ſo profound, is able to juſtifie it, or to make it good? Notwithſtanding his demurrer therefore, and notwithſtanding that by this his plea, his purpoſe was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17943:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> to arreſt and ſtay mens judgements, I truſt they will all, now, (no cauſe appearing to the contrarie,) proceede without any further delay, to give their ſentence againſt his Client, &amp; for &amp; in the behalfe of theſe two moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; Peerles Princes, who be the complaynants againſt him: namely, for Chriſt IESVS, in their acknowledging, and publiſhing him, onely to be the onely univerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſupreme Paſtor, and head of the whole Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon Earth, aſwell as of the Triumphant in Heaven: and for the King, in declaring and publiſhing him, under God, to be the onely Supreme Governor, over all manner of perſons, and in all kinde of cauſes, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, within his Dominions. Neyther doe I doubt, but all mens judgements, whenſoever upon good and well adviſed deliberation they ſhall pleaſe to give them, will paſſe accordingly. In the meane time, let us goe one to the ſecond Chapter, &amp; ſee if he have any better ſucceſſe in that, then he hath found in the former.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this ſecond Chapter of my former Booke, my Adverſarie ſuppoſeth, that my maine ſcope and purpoſe, was, to prove our Church, that is, the Church of the Proteſtants, to have beene, in the Apoſtles times: <hi>But never was there,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>poore Aſſertion ſo miſerably mangled.</hi> And true it is indeede, that it is miſerably mangled, and cut in pieces. But, by whom? namely, by himſelfe. For, my Aſſertion is not ſo ſhort, as he relateth it, nor is to end where he maketh it to end, but is of a longer, and larger extent: and being produced not by parts or pieces, but wholy and intirely, (as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17943:59"/> it ought,) it is this <hi>(viz.)</hi> That our Church was in the Apoſtles dayes, and in all times and ages ſince, howſoever, or, notwitſtanding, that Poperie did as an infection, or corruption grow unto it: the meaning &amp; true ſence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is no more, but, that the growing of Poperie, it being but as an infection or corruption to the Church, is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, or argument to the contrarie, but that our Church had a being in the Apoſtles dayes, and in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times and ages, that notwithſtanding. This will the better appeare, if you take the whole Propoſition or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and turne it into a Queſtion. For, then the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will not be, as mine Adverſary maketh it: <hi>(viz.)</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Church were in the Apoſtles dayes: for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth not the whole Propoſition, but is onely a part, or piece of it. Neyther can that be any more the Queſtion, then whether it were in the ſucceeding and aftertimes, and ages. But the Queſtion will bee, as I have ſignified before, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the growth and comming in of Poperie, as an infection or corruption to the Church, did hinder, or was any ſuch obſtacle, or impediment as that, by reaſon thereof, our Church had no being at all, in the Apoſtles dayes, nor in the dayes, and times ſucceeding. It is true, that if I had ſaid, that our Church was, in the Apoſtles times, and had gone no further: it had beene an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and direct affirmation of our Church to have beene in thoſe dayes. But when I goe further, and ſay, that our Church was in the Apoſtles dayes, notwithſtanding that the ſeeds of Popery began then to be ſowen: in this ſpeech, I doe not abſolutely, and ſimply affirme, that our Church was then, but that it was then, notwithſtanding that the ſeeds of Poperie began then to be ſowen: that is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and growth of Poperie, was no obſtacle, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or argument againſt the being of our Church in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17943:59"/> thoſe dayes. As likewiſe if I ſay, that the conveyance made to <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Stile</hi> is good, notwithſtanding that there was no liverie of ſeiſin made upon it: this is no direct affirmation, that his conveyance is ſimply good, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: but, that it is good, notwithſtanding this excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there was no liverie and ſeiſin made: that is, the not making of liverie of ſeiſin, is no obſtacle or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to hinder the goodneſſe of it. In like ſort, if I ſay, that K. <hi>Salomon</hi> was a ſaved ſoule, notwithſtanding that by the enticement of his wives, he became an Idolater: this is no abſolute or direct affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was a ſaved ſoule. But that he was a ſaved ſoule, notwithſtanding that reaſon or allegation: that is to ſay, his committing of Idolatrie, upon the enticement of his wives, is no ſuch obſtacle, or proofe to the contrarie, but that he might be a ſaved ſoule, that reaſon or objection notwithſtanding. As againe, if I ſay, that my Adverſarie is a good Grecian, or a good He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britian, notwithſtanding that he hath not ſhewed it in his Anſwere: this is no direct affirmation, that hee is eyther a good Grecian or a good Hebritian: but the ſence and meaning of that ſpeech is, that his not ſhewing of skill in Greeke or Hebrew in his Anſwere, is no obſtacle, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrarie, but that he may be a good Grecian, or a good Hebritian, that nothwithſtanding. Wherefore if mine Adverſarie would have oppoſed himſelfe, againſt that propoſition or aſſertion of mine before mentioned, he ſhould have ſhewed &amp; proved, (if he had beene able,) that the comming in, and growth of Poperie, was ſuch an impediment or obſtacle, as that by reaſon thereof our Church could haue no being in the Apoſtles dayes, or in the times, or ages that ſucceeded: which becauſe he hath not done, he hath ſpent his breath, and talked idly, and in vaine, and to no purpoſe. And yet hee ſeemeth to glorie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17943:60"/> and inſult over me, that my concluſion &amp; aſſertion, being (as he ſaith), that our Church was in the Apoſtles times, I brought not ſo much as one argument, there to prove it: how much more cauſe now have I, (if I were ſo diſpoſed), to glorie and inſult over him, who by his cutting, curtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mangling my aſſertion, and not taking it wholy and intirely, (as of right he ſhould,) hath utterly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Queſtion, &amp; not anſwered one word to that which was the Queſtion indeede. For the queſtion to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, out of this entier Propoſition, not being (as he hath ſtrangely miſtaken), whether our Church was in the Apoſtles times: nor yet, whether it were in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and aftertimes. But, whether Poperie were ſuch an obſtacle, or impediment, as that it did cauſe that our Church could not, by reaſon thereof, have any being at all, eyther in the Apoſtles times, or in the times and ages that ſucceeded: To this it is that I anſwered and adreſſed my ſpeech in that ſecond Chapter: and to this Queſtion alſo it is, that mine Adverſarie ſhould have anſwered, and adreſſed his ſpeech, if he would have ſpoken materially and to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And yet even this verie aſſertion, that our Church (that is men beleeving and profeſſing the ſame Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that we doe), was in the Apoſtles times, and by them taught and approved, is a thing evidently declared, not in one Chapter alone of my former Booke, (for one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, would not ſuffice, for ſo many points, and poſitions, as did to ſuch a matter belong) but in all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Church which holdeth the ſame Faith, doctrine, &amp; Religion, that the Apoſtles taught in their dayes, is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall: But our Church, that is the Church of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, holdeth the ſame Faith, doctrine and Religion, that the Apoſtles taught in their: <hi>Ergo</hi> our Church, that is, the Church of the Proteſtants, is Apoſtolicall. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> is verie evident of it ſelfe, and by the teſtimonie alſo of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> neyther can it be denied. The <hi>Minor</hi> is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by conferring, and comparing our Faith, doctrine, &amp; Religion, with the Apoſtolicall writings, &amp; the reſt of the Canonicall Scriptures. And it is alſo manifeſt, by the whole Contents of my former Booke, whether I referre you, for the proofe of it, (if any make doubt of it:) And therefore the concluſion muſt bee granted. On the other ſide, againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from that ground alſo, I thus frame my argument. That Church which holdeth a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17943:61"/> Religion, Faith, and doctrine, differing or contrarie to that which was taught by the Apoſtles in their times, is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall: But the Popiſh Church, holdeth a Religion, Faith, and doctrine, differing, or contrarie to that, which was taught by the Apoſtles in their times, (as is apparant, if you compare them together, examining the ſeverall, and particular Poſitions, in theſe points of Controverſie, by the writings of the Apoſtles, &amp; the reſt of the Canonicall Scriptures, &amp; as is alſo ſhewed at large in my former book; whether I likewiſe referre you, for the proofe of this <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition:) And therefore the Popiſh Church is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall. But mine Adverſarie taketh here exception to our Church, <hi>affirming it in three points to be hereticall. First in the point of Iuſtification. For,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it was the hereſie of the Symonians and Eunomians, to hold Iustification in Gods ſight, by grace, and by faith onely, as the Proteſtants doe. And, that S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>alſo affirmeth it to be an error, that ſprung up even in the Apoſtles dayes.</hi> But touching the <hi>Symonians,</hi> they held,<note place="margin">Ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What? Is it all one with Papiſts, to be ſaved by <hi>Simons</hi> grace, and by the grace of CHRIST? As for the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> ſuch was their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, as that they rejected, or made no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of good workes at all.<note place="margin">Aug. hareſ. <hi>54.</hi>

As the eye, in reſpect of the reſt of the members, wherewith it is accompanied, is not alone, yet in reſpect of the power and facultie of ſeeing, it is ſole and alone. And, as, in fire likewiſe, there is both heare, and light, and the heate is not alone, but accompanied with the light: and yet it is the heate onely, and not the light, that warmeth the bodie.

Or, in what Church

I further ſhewed in this ſecond Chapter, that the true Church, planted by the Apoſtles, was afterward by little, and little, and by degrees to grow corrupted, and to continue in thoſe her errors, corruptions and deformities, for a long time, even till after the ſixt Angell had begun to blow the Trumpet, according to the prediction &amp; Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof in the Revelation of S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> which Prophecie becauſe it is found to agree with our Church, and that it cannot be made to agree with theirs, which they will not grant to be, capable of any corruption, or error: It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo followeth, that not theirs, but ours, muſt needs be the true Church, planted by the Apoſtles. Theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I here the rather mention, that my adverſary might ſee, <hi>That the blast of the ſixt Angels trumpet, did not blow away all the arguments, which I ſhould have brought for my purpoſe, as he ſcoffingly ſpeaketh,</hi> being not able otherwiſe, or in other then a ſcoffing ſort, to anſwere them.
